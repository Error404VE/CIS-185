## Changes from Week 2 to Week 3

In Week 2, my portfolio was a static site with basic layout and minimal responsiveness. For Week 3, I created two new versions:

- **Manual Responsive Version:**
	- Added media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
	- Used flexible images, viewport units, CSS Grid, and Flexbox for layout.
	- Improved header styling and navigation responsiveness.

- **Bootstrap Responsive Version:**
	- Rebuilt the site using Bootstrap 5 for layout and components.
	- Used Bootstrap's grid system, cards, and form controls for fast, consistent responsiveness.
	- Migrated custom fonts and colors for a similar look to the manual version.

Both versions are fully responsive and visually similar, but use different techniques to achieve adaptability across devices.
